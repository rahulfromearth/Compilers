Objective:
		Write an Assembly Code Generator for the source language that we have chosen.

Work Flow: 
1. We have added some remaining semantic rules only so no assembly code generate right now as we couldn't give enough time for assignment.

New Implemented:
1. Type checking working.

NOT IMPLEMENTED:
1. no classes are implemented right now.
2. no object oriented implementations.
3. enum type not supported
4. conditional stmt ? : not working.
5. do while not implemented.
4. any type of 2D array not supported
5. can't make new type of a variable only some fixed types are implemented. 
6. function_instance removed because it was having some problems, so no recursion right now.
7. there is problem in precedence order.


Working:
Right now variable declaration is working proplery with most of the type of expression are handled. Also break and return handled.
rest we will submit along with assgn3.

Run:
```sh
make
bin/codegen test/test1.d # to execute first test-case file test1.d
```

Contains:

		dlex.py
		codegen.py
	test
		test1.d
		test2.d
		test3.d
		test4.d
		test5.d
		test6.d
